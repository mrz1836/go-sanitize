# Cursor Rules derived from .github/AGENTS.md

## Read AGENTS.md First
All contributors must read `.github/AGENTS.md` for complete guidelines. If any rule here conflicts with that file, **AGENTS.md** takes precedence.

## Coding Standards
- Format with `go fmt ./...` and `goimports -w .`.
- Lint with `golangci-lint run` and vet with `go vet ./...`.
- Run `go test ./...` before committing.
- Follow Go naming and commenting conventions described in AGENTS.md.

## Commit Messages
- Use the format `<type>(<scope>): <imperative short description>`.
- Types include `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`.

## Pull Requests
- Title format: `[Subsystem] Imperative and concise summary of change`.
- Description must include the sections:
  1. **What Changed**
  2. **Why It Was Necessary**
  3. **Testing Performed**
  4. **Impact / Risk**

## Dependency Management
- Manage modules with `go mod tidy` after import changes.
- Run `make govulncheck` to check for vulnerabilities when dependencies change.

## Security Reporting
- Do not open public issues for vulnerabilities.
- Follow `SECURITY.md` for responsible disclosure.
