# CLAUDE.md

## ðŸ¤– Welcome, Claude

This repository uses **`AGENTS.md`** as the single source of truth for:

* Coding conventions (naming, formatting, commenting, testing)
* Contribution workflows (branch prefixes, commit message style, PR templates)
* Release, CI, and dependencyâ€‘management policies
* Security reporting and governance links

> **TL;DR:** **Read `AGENTS.md` first.**
> All technical or procedural questions are answered there.

### Quick Checklist for Claude

1. **Study `AGENTS.md`**
   Make sure every automated change or suggestion respects those rules.
2. **Follow branchâ€‘prefix and commitâ€‘message standards**
   They drive Mergify autoâ€‘labeling and CI gates.
3. **Never tag releases**
4. **Pass CI**
   Run `go fmt`, `goimports`, `go vet`, `staticcheck`, and `golangciâ€‘lint` locally before opening a PR.

If you encounter conflicting guidance elsewhere, `AGENTS.md` wins.
Questions or ambiguities? Open a discussion or ping a maintainer instead of guessing.

Happy hacking!
