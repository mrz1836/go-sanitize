### 1. 🧠 Final Decisions

Project maintainers make the final call. They can revisit and revise past decisions. It keeps things moving.

### 2. 🧰 Contributions Welcome

Pitch in! Collaboration is a team sport. Don't leave others carrying your weight forever.

### 3. 🎯 Choose Your Adventure

Everyone can tackle whatever challenge they feel ready for. Grab an issue and go!

### 4. 🏗️ Earned Roles

Project influence is earned through consistent, quality contributions. Titles mean less than impact.

### 5. 🧪 Better > Worse

Good code replaces not-so-good code. Technical merit always wins.

### 6. 🔒 Keep It On Topic

This is a space for building software. Let's stay focused.

### 7. ⚖️ Take It Elsewhere

If something’s not about the project, take it to another channel. Let's not derail progress.

### 8. 🫶 We See People, Not Labels

Your identity—race, gender, beliefs, background—is irrelevant here. Code speaks louder.

### 9. 💬 Debate Ideas, Not People

Challenge code. Not humans. No exceptions.

### 10. 🔍 Be Clear

If your idea isn't clear, expect questions. If it stays unclear, expect crickets. Help us help you.

### 11. 🚫 Illegal is Illegal

Anything illegal outside the project is illegal here too. Keep it clean.

### 12. 📦 Project-Only Focus

This code of merit only applies to what happens *in* the project.

### 13. ✅ Participation = Agreement

By contributing, you're saying, "Yep, I'm in."

### 14. 🎯 Stick to the Mission

Trying to shift this project away from its purpose? That's not cool and won’t be allowed.
