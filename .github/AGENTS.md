# AGENTS.md

## üéØ Purpose & Scope

This file defines the **baseline standards, workflows, and structure** for *all contributors and AI agents* operating within this repository. It serves as the root authority for engineering conduct, coding conventions, and collaborative norms.

It is designed to help AI assistants (e.g., Codex, Claude, Cursor, Sweep AI) and human developers alike understand our practices, contribute clean and idiomatic code, and navigate the codebase confidently and effectively.

> Whether reading, writing, testing, or committing code, **you must adhere to the rules in this document.**

Additional `AGENTS.md` files **may exist in subdirectories** to provide more contextual or specialized guidance. These local agent files are allowed to **extend or override** the root rules to fit the needs of specific packages, services, or engineering domains‚Äîwhile still respecting the spirit of consistency and quality defined here.

## üîç Project Overview

`go-sanitize` is a specialized Go library for sanitizing and validating user‚Äëprovided data, ensuring that web applications and APIs process secure, normalized, and trusted inputs. It includes functions for:

- Removing or escaping dangerous HTML and script‚Äërelated tags
- Validating and formatting email addresses and URLs
- Stripping or trimming unwanted characters (including whitespace and special symbols)
- Escaping sequences that could lead to XSS (Cross‚ÄëSite Scripting) or SQL injection
- Normalizing various data types (e.g., time strings, XML content, URIs)

By using `go-sanitize`, developers can greatly reduce security risks from untrusted sources, handle complex input edge cases, and maintain clarity and consistency across Go projects.

## üõ† Makefile Overview

The repository's `Makefile` includes reusable targets from `.make/common.mk` and
`.make/go.mk`. The root file exposes a few high-level commands while the files
under `.make` contain the bulk of the build logic.

`common.mk` provides utility tasks for releasing with GoReleaser, tagging
releases, and updating the releaser tool. It also offers the `diff` and `help`
commands used across projects.

`go.mk` supplies Go-specific helpers for linting, testing, generating code,
building binaries, and updating dependencies. Targets such as `lint`, `test`,
`test-ci`, and `coverage` are defined here and invoked by the root `Makefile`.

Use `make help` to view the full list of supported commands.

## üß™ Development, Testing & Coverage Standards

All contributors‚Äîhuman or AI‚Äîmust follow these standards to ensure high-quality, maintainable, and idiomatic Go code throughout the project.

<br/><br/>

### üõ† Formatting & Linting

Code must be cleanly formatted and pass all linters before being committed.

```bash
go fmt ./...
goimports -w .
golangci-lint run
go vet ./...
```

> Refer to `.golangci.json` for the full set of enabled linters.

Editors should honor `.editorconfig` for indentation and whitespace rules, and
Git respects `.gitattributes` to enforce consistent line endings across
platforms.

<br/><br/>

### üß™ Testing Standards

We use the `testify` suite for unit tests. All tests must follow these conventions:

* Name tests using the pattern: `TestFunctionName_ScenarioDescription`
* Use `testify/assert` for general assertions
* Use `testify/require` for:
    * All error or nil checks
    * Any test where failure should halt execution
    * Any test where a pointer or complex structure is required to be used after the check
* Use `require.InDelta` or `require.InEpsilon` for floating-point comparisons
* Prefer **table-driven tests** for clarity and reusability
* Use subtests (`t.Run`) to isolate and describe scenarios
* **Optionally use** `t.Parallel()` , but try and avoid it unless testing for concurrency issues
* Avoid flaky, timing-sensitive, or non-deterministic tests

<br/><br/>

### üîç Fuzz Tests (Optional)

Fuzz tests help uncover unexpected edge cases by generating random inputs. While not required, they are encouraged for **small, self-contained functions**.

Best practices:
* Keep fuzz targets short and deterministic
* Seed the corpus with meaningful values
* Run fuzzers with `go test -fuzz=. -run=^$` when exploring edge cases
* Limit iterations for local runs to maintain speed

Run tests locally with:

```bash
go test ./...
```

> All tests must pass in CI prior to merge.

<br/><br/>

### üìà Code Coverage

* Code coverage thresholds and rules are defined in `codecov.yml`
* Aim to provide meaningful test coverage for all new logic and edge cases
* Avoid meaningless coverage (e.g., testing getters/setters or boilerplate)

<br/>

<br/>

## ‚úçÔ∏è Naming Conventions

Follow Go naming idioms and the standards outlined in [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go):

<br/>

### Packages

* Short, lowercase, one-word (e.g., `auth`, `rpc`, `block`)
* Avoid `util`, `common`, or `shared`
* Exception: standard lib wrapper like `httputil`
* Must have a clear concise package comment in a .go file with the same name as the package

<br/>

### Files

* Naming using: snake_case (e.g., `block_header.go`, `test_helper.go`)
* Go file names are lowercase
* Test files: `_test.go`
* Generated files: annotate with a `// Code generated by go generate; DO NOT EDIT.` header

<br/>

### Functions & Methods

* `VerbNoun` naming (e.g., `CalculateHash`, `ReadFile`)
* Constructors: `NewXxx` or `MakeXxx`
* Getters: field name only (`Name()`)
* Setters: `SetXxx(value)`

<br/>

### Variables

* Exported: `CamelCase` (e.g., `HTTPTimeout`)
* Internal: `camelCase` (e.g., `localTime`)
* Idioms: `i`, `j`, `err`, `tmp` accepted

<br/>

### Interfaces

* Single-method: use `-er` suffix (e.g., `Reader`, `Closer`)
* Multi-method: use role-based names (e.g., `FileSystem`, `StateManager`)

<br/>

## üìò Commenting Standards

Great engineers write great comments. You're not here to state the obvious‚Äîyou're here to document decisions, highlight edge cases, and make sure the next dev (or AI) doesn't repeat your mistakes.

### üß† Guiding Principles

* **Comment the "why", not the "what"**

  > The code already tells us *what* it's doing. Your job is to explain *why* it's doing it that way‚Äîespecially if it's non-obvious, nuanced, or a workaround.

* **Explain side effects, caveats, and constraints**

  > If the function touches global state, writes to disk, mutates shared memory, or makes assumptions‚Äîwrite it down.

* **Don't comment on broken code‚Äîfix or delete it**

  > Dead or disabled code with TODOs are bad signals. If it's not worth fixing now, delete it and add an issue instead.

* **Your comments are part of the product**

  > Treat them like UX copy. Make them clear, concise, and professional. You're writing for peers, not compilers.


### üî§ Function Comments (Exported)

Every exported function **must** include a Go-style comment that:

* Starts with the function name
* States its purpose clearly
* Documents:
  * **Steps**: Include if the function performs a non-obvious sequence of operations.
  * **Parameters**: Always describe all parameters when present.
  * **Return values**: Document return types and their meaning if not trivially understood.
  * **Side effects**: Note any I/O, database writes, external calls, or mutations that aren't local to the function.
  * **Notes**: Include any assumptions, constraints, or important context that the caller should know.


Here is a template for function comments that is recommended to use:

```go
// FunctionName does [what this function does] in [brief context].
//
// This function performs the following steps: [if applicable, describe the main steps in a bullet list]
// - [First major action or check performed]
// - [Second action or branching logic explained, if relevant]
//    - [Details about possible outcomes or internal branching]
// - [Additional steps with sub-bullets as needed]
// - [Final steps and cleanup, if applicable]
//
// Parameters:
// - ctx: [Purpose of context in this function]
// - paramName: [Explanation of each parameter and what it controls or affects]
//
// Returns:
// - [What is returned; error behavior if any]
//
// Side Effects:
// - [Any side effects, such as modifying global state, writing to disk, etc.]
//
// Notes:
// - [Caveats, assumptions, or recommendations‚Äîe.g., transaction usage, concurrency, etc.]
// - [Any implicit contracts with the caller or system constraints]
// - [Mention if this function is part of a larger workflow or job system]
```


### üì¶ Package-Level Comments

* Each package **must** include a package-level comment in a file named after the package (e.g., `auth.go` for package `auth`).
* If no logical file fits, add a `doc.go` with the comment block.
* Use it to explain:
    * The package purpose
    * High-level API boundaries
    * Expected use-cases and design notes

Here is a template for package comments that is recommended to use:

```go
// Package PackageName provides [brief description of the package's purpose].
//
// This package implements [high-level functionality or API] and is designed to [describe intended use cases].
//
// Key features include: [if applicable, list key features or components]
// - [Feature 1: brief description of what it does]
// - [Feature 2: brief description of what it does]
// - [Feature 3: brief description of what it does]
//
// The package is structured to [explain any architectural decisions, e.g., modularity, separation of concerns].
// It relies on [mention any key dependencies or external systems].
//
// Usage examples:
// [Provide a simple example of how to use the package, if applicable]
//
// Important notes:
// - [Any important assumptions or constraints, e.g., concurrency model, state management]
// - [Any known limitations or edge cases]
// - [Any specific configuration or initialization steps required]
//
// This package is part of the larger [Project Name] ecosystem and interacts with [mention related packages or systems].
package PackageName
```


### üß± Inline Comments

Use inline comments **strategically**, not excessively.

* Use them to explain "weird" logic, workarounds, or business rules.
* Prefer **block comments (`//`)** on their own line over trailing comments.
* Avoid obvious noise:

üö´ `i++ // increment i`

‚úÖ `// Skip empty rows to avoid panic on CSV parse`


### ‚öôÔ∏è Comment Style

* Use **complete sentences** with punctuation.
* Keep your tone **precise, confident, and modern**‚Äîyou're not writing a novel, but you're also not writing legacy COBOL.
* Avoid filler like "simple function" or "just does X".
* Don't leave TODOs unless:
    * They are immediately actionable
    * (or) they reference an issue
    * They include a timestamp or owner

### üß¨ AI Agent Directives

If you're an AI contributing code:

* Treat your comments like commit messages‚Äî**use active voice, be declarative**
* Use comments to **make intent explicit**, especially for generated or AI-authored sections
* Avoid hallucinating context‚Äîif you're unsure, omit or tag with `// AI: review this logic`
* Flag areas of uncertainty or external dependency (e.g., "// AI: relies on external config structure")

### üî• Comment Hygiene

* Remove outdated comments aggressively.
* Keep comments synced with refactoring.
* Use `//nolint:<linter> // message` only with clear, justified context and explanation.

<br/>

<br/>

## üìù Modifying Markdown Documents

Markdown files (e.g., `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) are first-class citizens in this repository. Edits must follow these best practices:

* **Write with intent** ‚Äî Be concise, clear, and audience-aware. Each section should serve a purpose.
* **Use proper structure** ‚Äî Maintain consistent heading levels, spacing, and bullet/number list formatting.
* **Full Table Borders** ‚Äî Use full borders for tables to ensure readability across different renderers.
* **Table Border Spacing** ‚Äî Make sure tables have appropriate spacing for clarity.
* **Preserve voice and tone** ‚Äî Match the professional tone and style used across the project documentation.
* **Preview before committing** ‚Äî Always verify rendered output locally or in a PR to avoid broken formatting.
* **Update references** ‚Äî When renaming files or sections, update internal links and the table of contents if present.

> Markdown updates should be treated with the same care as code‚Äîclean, purposeful, and reviewed.

<br/>

---

<br/>

## üö® Error Handling (Go)

* Always check errors

```go
if err != nil {
  return err
}
```

* Prefer `errors.New()` over `fmt.Errorf`
* Use custom error types sparingly
* Avoid returning ambiguous errors; provide context

<br/>

---

<br/>

## üîÄ Commit & Branch Naming Conventions

Clear history ‚áí easy maintenance. Follow these rules for every commit and branch.

### üìå Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <imperative short description>

<body>  # optional, wrap at 72 chars
```

* **`<type>`** ‚Äî `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`
* **`<scope>`** ‚Äî Affected subsystem or package (e.g., `api`, `sanitize`, `deps`). Omit if global.
* **Short description** ‚Äî ‚â§ 50 chars, imperative mood ("add pagination", "fix panic")
* **Body** (optional) ‚Äî What & why, links to issues (`Closes #123`), and breaking‚Äëchange note (`BREAKING CHANGE:`)

**Examples**

```
feat(sanitizer): add new sanitization method Thing()
fix(generator): handle malformed JSON input gracefully
docs(README): improve installation instructions
```

> Commits that only tweak whitespace, comments, or docs inside a PR may be squashed; otherwise preserve granular commits.

### üå± Branch Naming

| Purpose            | Prefix      | Example                            |
|--------------------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| Bug Fix            | `fix/`      | `fix/code-off-by-one`              |
| Chore / Meta       | `chore/`    | `chore/upgrade-go-1.23`            |
| Documentation      | `docs/`     | `docs/agents-commenting-standards` |
| Feature            | `feat/`     | `feat/pagination-api`              |
| Hotfix (prod)      | `hotfix/`   | `hotfix/rollback-broken-deploy`    |
| Prototype / Spike  | `proto/`    | `proto/iso3166-expansion`          |
| Refactor / Cleanup | `refactor/` | `refactor/remove-dead-code`        |
| Tests              | `test/`     | `test/generator-edge-cases`        |

* Use **kebab‚Äëcase** after the prefix.
* Keep branch names concise yet descriptive.
* PR titles should mirror the branch's purpose (see [‚úÖ Pull Request Conventions](#-pull-request-conventions)).

> CI rely on these prefixes for auto labeling and workflow routing‚Äîstick to them.

<br/>

<br/>

## ‚úÖ Pull Request Conventions

Pull Requests‚Äîwhether authored by humans or AI agents‚Äîmust follow a consistent structure to ensure clarity, accountability, and ease of review.

### üîñ Title Format

```
[Subsystem] Imperative and concise summary of change
```

Examples:

* `[API] Add pagination to client search endpoint`
* `[DB] Migrate legacy rate table schema`
* `[CI] Remove deprecated GitHub Action for testing`

> Use the imperative mood ("Add", "Fix", "Update") to match the style of commit messages and changelogs.

### üìù Pull Request Description

Every PR must include the following **four** sections in the description:

#### 1. **What Changed**

> A clear, bullet‚Äëpointed or paragraph‚Äëlevel summary of the technical changes.

#### 2. **Why It Was Necessary**

> Context or motivation behind the change. Reference related issues, discussions, or bugs if applicable.

#### 3. **Testing Performed**

> Document:
>
> * Test suites run (e.g., `TestCreateOriginationAccount`)
> * Edge cases covered
> * Manual steps that were taken (if any)

#### 4. **Impact / Risk**

> Call out:
>
> * Breaking changes
> * Regression risk
> * Performance implications
> * Changes in developer experience (e.g., local dev setup, CI time)

### üí° Additional PR Guidelines

* Link related issues with keywords like `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456` if there is a known issue.
* Keep PRs focused and minimal. Prefer multiple small PRs over large ones when possible.
* Use draft PRs early for feedback on in progress work.
* Releases are deployed using **goreleaser**.
* Rules for the release build are located in `.goreleaser.yml` and executed via `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

## üè∑Ô∏è Labeling Conventions (GitHub)

Labels serve as shared vocabulary for categorizing issues, pull requests, and discussions. Proper labeling improves triage, prioritization, automation, and clarity across the engineering lifecycle.

Current labels are located in `.github/labels.yml` and automatically synced into GitHub upon updating the `master` branch.

### üé® Standard Labels & Usage

| Label Name         | Color     | Description                                                | When to Use                                                                 |

### üß† Labeling Best Practices

* Apply labels at the time of PR/issue creation, or during triage.
* Use **only one priority label** (`bug-P1`, `P2`, `P3`) per item.
* Combine labels as needed (e.g., `feature` + `ui-ux` + `test`).
* Don't forget to remove outdated labels (e.g., `work-in-progress` ‚Üí after merge readiness).

<br/>

---

<br/>

## üß© CI & Validation

CI automatically runs on every PR to verify:

* Formatting (`go fmt` and `goimports`)
* Linting (`golangci-lint run`)
* Tests (`go test ./...`)
* Fuzz tests (if applicable) (`make run-fuzz-tests`)
* This codebase uses GitHub Actions; test workflows reside in `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`
* Pin each external GitHub Action to a **full commit SHA** (e.g., `actions/checkout@2f3b4a2e0e471e13e2ea2bc2a350e888c9cf9b75`) as recommended by GitHub's [security hardening guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-pinned-actions). Dependabot will track and update these pinned versions automatically.

Failing PRs will be blocked. AI agents should iterate until CI passes.

<br/>

## üîê Dependency Management

Dependency hygiene is critical for security, reproducibility, and developer experience. Follow these practices to ensure our module stays stable, up to date, and secure.

### üì¶ Module Management

* All dependencies must be managed via **Go Modules** (`go.mod`, `go.sum`)

* After adding, updating, or removing imports, run:

  ```bash
  go mod tidy
  ```

* Periodically refresh dependencies with:

  ```bash
  go get -u ./...
  ```

> Avoid unnecessary upgrades near release windows‚Äîreview major version bumps carefully for breaking changes.

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Scanning

* Use [govulncheck](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck) to identify known vulnerabilities:
```bash
  govulncheck ./...
```

* Run via make command: 
```bash
  make govulncheck
```

* Address critical advisories before merging changes into `master`

* Document any intentionally ignored vulnerabilities with clear justification and issue tracking

* We follow the [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org) best practices to ensure this repository remains compliant with industry‚Äëstandard open source security guidelines

### üìÅ Version Control

* Never manually edit `go.sum`
* Do not vendor dependencies; we rely on modules for reproducibility
* Lockstep upgrades across repos (when applicable) should be coordinated and noted in PRs

> Changes to dependencies should be explained in the PR description and ideally linked to the reason (e.g., bug fix, security advisory, feature requirement).

## üõ°Ô∏èSecurity Considerations & Vulnerability Reporting

Security is a first-class requirement. If you discover a vulnerability‚Äîno matter how small‚Äîfollow our responsible disclosure process:

* **Do not** open a public issue or pull request.
* Follow the instructions in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
* Include:
  * A clear, reproducible description of the issue
  * Proof‚Äëof‚Äëconcept code or steps (if possible)
  * Any known mitigations or workarounds
* You will receive an acknowledgment within **72 hours** and status updates until the issue is resolved.

> For general hardening guidance (e.g., `govulncheck`, dependency pinning), see the [üîêDependency Management](#-dependency-management) section.
